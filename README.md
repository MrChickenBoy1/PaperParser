Version 0.0.0 - This is a super, duper, simple version of what I have in my mind. At this point, there's just one PDF and a basic LangChain implementation to extract the text of the PDF, and an Ollama local hosting to process the text. This was created just to get something working, but the end result will definitely be done using JSON files. My next plan is to create a JSON extractor program, but I may resort to manual labeling for now using ChatGPT. 

Version 0.0.1 - work in progress.
